1. Server Provisioning:

Launched an Amazon EC2 instance utilizing the Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS operating system.
Selected an appropriate instance type (t2.micro) for the project's initial requirements.
Configured a security group within AWS to permit inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) for secure remote access and port 80 (HTTP) to enable web traffic.
2. Server Setup and Configuration:

Established an SSH connection to the newly launched EC2 instance.
Updated the system's package lists and upgraded existing packages to their latest versions using apt update and apt upgrade -y.
Installed the Apache2 web server using apt install apache2.
Started and enabled the Apache2 service to run automatically on system boot using systemctl start apache2 and systemctl enable apache2.
3. Project Deployment:

Created a local HTML file containing:
The project title: "Welcome to [Your Name] Landing Page."
A brief project description.
Your name and a concise bio.
Created a project directory within the server's document root: sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/your_project_name.
Transferred the HTML file to the server using scp or another secure file transfer method.
Cloned the project's Git repository to the server using sudo -u www-data git clone git@github.com:your_username/your_repository_name.git /var/www/html/your_project_name.
4. Apache Configuration:

Created a VirtualHost configuration file (/etc/apache2/sites-available/your_project_name.conf) to define the server's behavior for this specific project.
Configured the VirtualHost with appropriate directives, including the DocumentRoot path and AllowOverride settings.
Enabled the new VirtualHost configuration using a2ensite your_project_name.conf.
Disabled the default Apache site (a2dissite 000-default.conf) to avoid conflicts.
Restarted the Apache service (systemctl restart apache2) to apply the configuration changes.
5. Verification and Testing:

Accessed the deployed landing page by navigating to the server's public IP address in a web browser.
Verified the correct display of the HTML content.
This comprehensive approach outlines the key steps undertaken to provision the server, set up the web server environment, deploy the project, and configure Apache to serve the landing page effectively.
